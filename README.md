# TODO

This is mostly just a fun project, hence the code being even worse than my usual stuff.

This might move over to the [AIM](https://github.com/Aim-Educational) group if Nathan wants to work on it at all as well.

Because a *certain someone* might be looking at this - I don't have express permission from Andy and Laura to have their images here, but:

    1. I doubt they care at all for a project that's mostly just between me and maybe Nathan.
    2. I've only used already-public images.
    3. There's very little chance they'd say no if I did ask anyway, but I haven't been to the farm recently to ask.
    4. If you somehow count their usage in a harmless joke project, that they'd probably have a quick laugh at once they've seen it, as harassment, then that's your problem.
